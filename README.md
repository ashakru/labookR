# labookR
Lab book in R

Open science project to create unified electronic lab book framework in R syntax in order to support wet-lab data reproducibility, facilitate data analysis and projects management.  

## Background   

There is an intense effort to improve reproducibility and transparency in modern research culture, so it is not surprising that electronic lab notebooks (ELN) slowly supersede ith paper versions. Most of the avaliable ELN lacks flexibility, cannot be taliored to one's needs and are not open source, which may limit their accessibility. 

#### Core functionality  

* R notebooks with enhanced functionality, eg. easy import of repeated experimental protocols.  
* Modular design, tag-based project management with interactive project/experiment access (entry - metadata).  
* Integrated version control system (eg. git).  
* R syntax access to archived experiments/protocols/projects (output could be organised from different levels and published as eg. Shiny app). 
* Media upload syntax (eg. to attach WB gels, flow cytometry charts etc.).  
* Expanded tutorials and manuals for non-coding users.
